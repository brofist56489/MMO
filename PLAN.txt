Decide what kind of game im making
    Things to keep in mind:
        Some kind of MMO:
            like WOW, many people can all see each other
            like N, lot of people, no coop / verses
        
    Board Game:
        See other people
        Remake table board game
        Come up with something interesting
            Im stuck...
    
    Challenge Type Game:
        User created levels
        Platformer?
        Puzzler?
    
    Town / City Builder -- This is what im thinking
        Inividual City
        personal cities, public cities.
        
        Tell a story? Like Banished.
        
        Tech Tree?
        Stay Low Level?
        
        Collect and Maintain many resources? Yes, but only some resources
        
        World simulates when gone?
        World simulated on the client or server side?
            client side simulation
            server double checks
            client saves remotely frequently
            
        World size:
            Definitely not infinite.
            depends on what the gameplay will be like.
            100x100 is a decent size.
        
        2D:
            Easy Rendering
                Squares with preset materials
                No Raycasting neccisary (thats not even close to how its spelled).
        
        2.5D:
            Same as 2D just rendered in 3D.
            
        3D:
            Even more like Banished
            Would need a nice GUI.
