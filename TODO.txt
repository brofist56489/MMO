HOMEWORK FIRST!!!!

Input Handling of all sorts.
    Keyboard DONE! (thanks to KeyboardJS)
    Write mouse code DONE!
    

Work out how to do 2d rendering with Three js (or find another library).
Found pixi.js... Dont like having to store all the sprites (bad for tilemap).

Things to be done:
    (April 11) 3d terrain making with heightmaps!!!!
        1. Gen heightmaps DONE!
        2. port them to geometry. DONE! (mostly, need to make it look good).

    (April 12) decide how things will be rendered.
    	1. flat 2d map with each tile being a mesh.
    	2. terrain like RCT3 would be cool.
    	3. ...
    	THREE JS IS NOT FAST ENOUGH (for what I want), SWITCHING TO CANVAS RENDERING.

    (April 14) continue working on RenderJS.
        1. image clipping DONE!
        2. full matrix control. MOSTLY DONE!

    (April 15) redo code so it works with new library.
        1. TileMap
               write a 2d vector library for making things easier.
